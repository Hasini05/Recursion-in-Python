# Recursion-in-Python

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It is commonly used in tasks like traversing data structures (e.g., trees), solving mathematical problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci), and breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems. Each recursive call reduces the problem size, and the function returns once it reaches a base case. Proper use of recursion helps write clean and concise code.
